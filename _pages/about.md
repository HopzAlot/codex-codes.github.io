I am a Backend/DevOps Engineer based in Islamabad, Pakistan, with a strong interest in building and operating reliable software systems.

My learning approach is heavily project-driven, focusing on backend development, infrastructure automation, and cloud deployment. I enjoy working with containerized applications, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms to understand how software moves from development to production.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of backend engineering and DevOps—how services communicate, how systems scale, and how infrastructure design impacts performance and reliability. My goal is to grow into an engineer capable of designing, deploying, and maintaining production-grade systems that solve real-world problems.

**Languages:** Python, Java, C++  
**Frontend:** React  
**Backend:** Django  
**Database:** PostgreSQL  
**Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions  
**Tools I'm learning:** Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Jenkins
